This is a DotCloudified version of Siwapp, a Symfony app for managing
invoices.

To run this code on DotCloud, you need to `get a DotCloud account
<https://www.dotcloud.com/accounts/register/>`_. DotCloud has a free tier,
so you won't even need to draw your wallet!

Then clone this repository::

  $ git clone git://github.com/markerdmann/Siwapp.git

And push it to DotCloud::

  $ cd Siwapp
  $ dotcloud push siwapp

Happy hacking! Remember: each time you modify something, you need to
git add + git commit your changes before doing "dotcloud push".

<http://docs.dotcloud.com/>`_, especially the one for the `PHP service
<http://docs.dotcloud.com/services/php/>`_ which is used by this app.
